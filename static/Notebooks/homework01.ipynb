    "In the 8-Puzzle problem we are given a 3x3 grid. 8 out of the 9 squares are filled with tiles containing a number (1-8). Our goal in this puzzle is to arrange the numbers in sorted order, left to right, top to bottom as illustrated in the above figure. As mentioned in class, A* is an \"informed\" search strategy which means we will need some kind of heuristic to solve our problem. In this solution we will use something called the \"Manhattan Distance\".\n",
