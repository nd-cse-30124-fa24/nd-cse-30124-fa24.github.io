    ## Task 1: Blog Post

    For this homework, just follow and implement the instructions in this blog post:

    <a href="https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2022/01/17/imdb-movie-review-sentiment-analysis-using-an-lstm-with-pytorch/">IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using an LSTM with PyTorch</a>

    Then submit it to a git branch and make a pull request.

    <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
    Accessing the dataset in colab is a little trickier than I intended, but given below are the steps:

    Go to this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bpkT5JmhDxsORu-gvljkay0IyKh6XY9F?usp=sharing and then "add shortcut to drive"

    Then using the code below, you should be able to access the dataset in your colab notebook.
    </div> 

    <pre>
      <code class="python">
        from google.colab import drive
        import os

        # Mount Google Drive
        drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)

        # Path to the shared folder
        dataset_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/aclImdb'
        os.chdir(dataset_path)

        # List files in the dataset folder
        print("Files in the aclImdb dataset folder:")
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(dataset_path):
            for file in files:
                print(os.path.join(root, file))
      </code>
    </pre>

    <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
    **Note**: I intend to ask at **least** one question about this on the final exam, 
    blindly copy the code in the blogpost at your own discretion.
    </div>

    To submit your answers, you will need add your `homework0910.ipynb` file
    in the `homework0910` folder of your **assignments** repository:

    Answer the questions in your notebook file using the method of your choice and
    once you are finished, follow the instructions below to submit your notebook.

    1. For this class, you must use a **separate [git] branch for each
    assignment**.  This means that the work for each reading and challenge must
    be done in a separate branch.  To create and checkout a new branch, you can
    do the following:

            :::bash
            $ git checkout main         # Make sure we are in master branch
            $ git pull --rebase           # Make sure we are up-to-date with github repository

            $ git checkout -b homework0910   # Create homework0910 branch and check it out

        Once you do the above, you should see the following output for the
        [git-branch] command:

            :::bash
            $ git branch
              main
              homework00
              homework01
              homework02
              homework03
              homework04
              homework05
            * homework0910

        The `*` indicates that we are currently on the `homework0910` branch.

    2. Once you have your notebook filled out, you need to add, commit the file, and
    push your commits to [GitHub]:

            :::bash
            $ git add homework0910.ipynb                # Add answers.json to staging area
            $ git commit -m "Homework 09 and 10: Done"    # Commit work

            $ git push -u origin homework0910        # Push branch to GitHub

        <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
        **Note**: You may edit and commit changes to your branch as many times
        as you wish.  Just make sure all of your work goes in the appropriate
        branch and then perform a `git push` when you are done.
        </div>

    3. When you are ready for your final submission, you need to create a
    **pull request** via the [GitHub] interface:

        - First, go to your repository's **Branches** page and then press the
        **New pull request** button for the appropriate branch:

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_1.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

        - Next, edit the **pull request** title to "Homework 09 and 10", write a
          comment if necessary and then press the "Create pull request" button.

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_2.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

        - Finally, assign the **pull request** to the **teaching assistant**
          assigned to you for the given week. 

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_3.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

    <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
    #### <i class="fa fa-gavel"></i> Graders

    Please refer to the [Homework 09 TA List](reading09_tas.html) to determine
    who your grader is for this week.

    </div>

    Once you have made the **pull request**, the instructor or teaching
    assistant can verify your work and provide feedback via the discussion form
    inside the **pull request**.  If necessary, you can update your submission
    by simply committing and pushing to the appropriate branch; the **pull
    request** will automatically be updated to match your latest work.

    When all work is graded, the grader will merge your branch and close the
    **pull request**.

    <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
    **Note**: Please **do not merge** your own **pull request**.  This makes it
    more difficult for the graders to keep track of what needs to be graded.
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

    #### <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> Qualitative Feedback

    The purpose of this workflow is to provide you with better feedback.
    Instead of simply determining if your work is correct, the instructor will
    attempt to provide you with more **qualitative feedback** such as whether
    or not you used good programming practices or if your code could be
    improved or organized better.

    The hope is that this will help you grow as programmers and develop some
    **taste** :).
